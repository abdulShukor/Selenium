 Interview Questions:
What is the difference between Relative and absolute xpath?
Relative- Does not depend on parent nodes and its prefer 
Parent/child- Absolute xpath –
 you have to figure out how many matching element you have by making the xpath or css 
you cannot traverse to sibling using css which can be consider and drawback of css 
 How to traverse to sibling element using xpath?
.//*[@id='tablist1-tab1']/following-sibling::li[2]
How to traverse back to Parent element from Child element using Xpath?
.//*[@id='tablist1-tab1']/parent::ul	
 How to identify element with Text based?
 
 // traverse through the parent node to the child if the child node is static 
		// //tagname[@attribute='ad']/div/div/[2 mean second child]/input
		// it the it dynamic then use sibling or parent relashionship 
		

		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//ul[@class='responsive-tabs__list']/li[1]/following-sibling::li[2]")).click();

		System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='tablist1-tab2']/parent::ul")).getAttribute("role"));
		//
 
 you cannot traverse back through css its only forward moving and its 10 times faster 
 
 css selector 
 #id, for css if the class name has spaces then replace it by dots, always look for unique attribute
