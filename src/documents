Classes should not have spaces- Compound classes cannot be accepted
Multipl values - Selenium identifies the first one- Scans from top left
Double quotes inside double quotes are not accepted
Xpath/CSS  can be defined in n number of ways
Rightclick copy on blue highlighted html code to generate xpath
Firepath depreciated from firefox- 
when xpath starts with html-Not reliable- Switch browser to get another one
There is no direct way to get CSS in chrome. You will find it in tool bar
Degrade browser to less firefox 55 to ge Firepath
$("") - for css ,    $x("")   or xpath
//tagName[@attribute='value']  - xpath syntax
tagName[attribute='value']  -CSS  tagName#id- CSS   tagname.classname- CSS
//tagName[contains(@attribute,'value')]  - xpath regular expression
tagName[Atrribute*='value'] - Css regular expression

 Interview Questions:
What is the difference between Relative and absolute xpath?
Relative- Does not depend on parent nodes and its prefer 
Parent/child- Absolute xpath –
 you have to figure out how many matching element you have by making the xpath or css 
you cannot traverse to sibling using css which can be consider and drawback of css 
 How to traverse to sibling element using xpath?
.//*[@id='tablist1-tab1']/following-sibling::li[2]
How to traverse back to Parent element from Child element using Xpath?
.//*[@id='tablist1-tab1']/parent::ul	
 How to identify element with Text based?
 
 3.0 Title 
 parent and child relationship 
 // traverse through the parent node to the child if the child node is static 
		// //tagname[@attribute='ad']/div/div/[2 mean second child]/input
		// it the it dynamic then use sibling or parent relashionship 
		

		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//ul[@class='responsive-tabs__list']/li[1]/following-sibling::li[2]")).click();

		System.out.println(driver.findElement(By.xpath(".//*[@id='tablist1-tab2']/parent::ul")).getAttribute("role"));
		//
 
 you cannot traverse back through css its only forward moving and its 10 times faster 
 
 css selector 
 #id, for css if the class name has spaces then replace it by dots, always look for unique attribute

		// implicit wait is globally define and it apply to all step. 
		// -- if the result show in 3 seconds it will not wait for the define time 
		// Explicit wait is define for particular object. its not global level 
		// combination of both is ideal 
		// thread is sleep the or holding the test for the define time even if the result 
		//-- is out or load sooner then the define time. it not prefer to use it 
		
		
Title 5.0

The Selenium WebDriver's Advanced User Interactions API allows us to perform operations from
keyboard events and simple mouse events to complex events such as dragging-and-dropping,
holding a key and then performing mouse operations by using the Actions class, and building
a complex chain of events exactly like a user doing these manually.
The Actions class implements the builder pattern to create a composite action containing a
group of other actions

We need to create an instance of the Actions class by passing the instance of driver class
to the constructor in the following way:
Actions builder = new Actions(driver);


HTML frames allow developers to present documents in multiple views, which may be
independent windows or subwindows. Multiple views offer developers a way to keep certain
information visible, while other views are scrolled or replaced. For example, within the same
window, one frame might display a static banner, the second a navigation menu, and the third
the main document that can be scrolled through or replaced by navigating in the second frame.

switching to other frame from the current frame
you  do not  need to change if are to nested frame 
then you to change to default page any option out of the frame
